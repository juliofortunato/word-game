## Demo

You can check the fully-working demo at [word-game.juliofortunato.dev](https://word-game.juliofortunato.dev).

## How to play
The goal of the game is to figure out a randomly-choosed specific word in six 
guesses or fewer.

After entering the first guess, you get some feedback about 
the letters of your word:

- Gray letters are not part of the word
- Yellow letter are part of the word, but are misplaced
- Green letters are part of the word and are on their correct position
